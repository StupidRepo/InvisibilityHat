## About this Mod
### What does this mod do?
It adds a new item called **the Invisibility Hat**! It will make you be invisible to *ANY* entity (players, mobs, animals) for up to 10 seconds (extendable up to 30 seconds!), but if you disable your invisibility, let's say, 6 seconds after you enabled it then you won't be able to mine blocks, place blocks or attack mobs for 3 seconds (half of 6 seconds), etc.

### I don't understand...
So, the amount of seconds you had the invisibility on for is the number of seconds, divided by 2 (so half), you can't mine blocks, place blocks, or attack mobs.

## FAQ

### What about mobs chasing you?
When you go invisible, anything that is chasing you or targeting you (zombies, angry wolves, etc.) **will stop chasing/targeting** you... until you are visible again.

### Where is the mod's version? Why does it only say "invisible"?
I thought it'd be funny to make it so you can't see the mod version. But don't worry, I am actively updating the mod with bug fixes and new updates.

### Why isn't the 'interesting mechanic' working?
Currently, I still need to make it so you can't mine blocks, break blocks or attack mobs. It's harder than it seems, trust me. It should be released `soon`. Come back here to see if the time has changed.
